
Windows 95 & Windows NT users:

1.  There's a pre-built executable, bzip.exe, which
    should work.  You don't need to compile anything.
    You can run the `test.bat' batch file to check
    the executable is working ok, if you want.

2.  The control-C signal catcher seems pretty dodgy
    under Windows, at least for the executable supplied.
    When it catches a control-C, bzip tries to delete
    its output file, so you don't get left with a half-
    baked file.  But this sometimes seems to fail
    under Windows.  Caveat Emptor!  I think I am doing
    something not-quite-right in the signal catching.
    Windows-&-C gurus got any suggestions?

    Control-C handling all seems to work fine under Unix.
