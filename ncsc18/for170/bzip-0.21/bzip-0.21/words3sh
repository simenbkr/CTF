If you got this far and the "bzip -Q -dV"s give identical
stored vs computed CRCs, you're probably in business.
Complete instructions for use are in the preformatted manual page, 
in the file bzip1.txt.

You can also do "bzip --help" to see some helpful information. 
"bzip -L" displays the software license.

Please read the README file carefully.  
Finally, note that bzip comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

Happy compressing!
